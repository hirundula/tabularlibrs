<h1>Tabularlib</h1>
<p>This is a small library for abstract matrices that I made as a practice project. Unlike regular 2d vectors, it actually uses a single vector and gets each of the cells' coordinates using some arithmetic calculations. The compiler doesn't have to run a bunch of vectors now, and performance is therefore increased.</p>
<p>This project is currently beta, and I plan to expand the code more and include more features, as well as make a separate shell.<p/>
<h2>Features</h2>>
<ul>
  <li>Basic matrix building</li>
  <li>Better performance than 2d vectors</li>
  <li>User-friendly code (I hope)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Planned features</h2>>
<ul>
  <li>Matrix algebra</li>
</ul>
<h2>Note!</h2>
<p>I didn't intend to make anything new, and I know that there might be other libraries that do what I want to do better. It's just, once again, a practice project; if you want, you may use it in your open source or personal projects as well.</p>
<p>All the best! :)</p>
